# Grade Calculator
## Ben Lorentz

This project was a way for me to brush up on my Java skills for Comp 271

I wanted to create a program that calculated weighted grades for me

Function
========
The program prompts a user to enter "S" or "C" to either calculate a "Section's" grade or a "Course's" grade based on data the user enters

   If the user selects "S" then the program will prompt how many assignments are in a section
   The program then asks the user to enter the possible points earned for each assignment in order 
   and press enter after every assignment.
   The program then prompts the user to enter the actual points earned for each assignment in      
   order and to press enter after every assignment.
   The program then returns the calculated score for that section.

//in the future I hope to impliment quality check that makes sure the user does not enter points that are over the possible earned.

   If the user selects "C" then the program will prompt how many sections are in a class
   The program then prompts for the name of the section
   The progrma then prompts for the weight of this section as a decimal.
   The program then prompts for the earned percentage as a decimal.
   The program repeats this loop until the number of sections is correct.
   The program returns the final grade in the class.

//In the future I want some kind of feedback to show how much weight has been used ie 1-.4 = .6 left as well as have the program check this for QC
